## Overview

**SLACKER IT – AI Suite** provides an end-to-end solution for:
- **Local AI inference** (using Ollama and other open-source tools)
- **Knowledge base** creation and management
- **PDF text/image extraction**
- **Model fine-tuning** with quantization, LoRA, and more

It features multiple **GUI applications** for user-friendly interaction, alongside **backend modules** handling API calls, session management, web search, and local retrieval.

---

## Key Features

- **Ollama Setup Wizard** – Simplifies installing and configuring the **Ollama** local AI platform  
- **Knowledge Base Manager** – Add and manage text documents in a local knowledge base  
- **Chat Interface** – Interact with local AI models in a user-friendly chat window, with optional knowledge-base context
- **PDF Tools** – Convert PDF text into training data, or extract images from PDFs  
- **Model Trainer** – Fine-tune models with LoRA, quantization, and more  
- **Session Management** – Save and restore conversation data, track logs

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. (Optional) **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** and any additional libraries your scripts require (e.g., `torch`, `transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, `Pillow`, etc.).

## Usage

### Primary GUI Tools

- **`main.py`** – Launches a unified interface to access all tools in the suite (e.g., knowledge base manager, Ollama wizard, PDF tools, etc.).
- **`OllamaWizard.py`** – Guides you through installing and configuring **Ollama**. Checks system prerequisites, helps with model downloads.
- **`kb_gui.py`** – Manage local text documents, update the knowledge base index, and handle file-based knowledge.
- **`chat_gui_main.py`** – A user-friendly chat interface to interact with your local AI model.
- **`cuttrainfile.py`** – Extract text from PDFs to generate training datasets.
- **`ollamadataprep.py`** / **`ollamatrainer.py`** – Tools for advanced data preparation and model fine-tuning.
- **`PDFMaster.py`** – Extract images from PDFs (e.g., for data or reference).

### Backend Modules

- **`api.py`** – Interacts with the **Ollama** API for listing models, generating responses, and checking server status.
- **`core_manager.py`** – Orchestrates session handling, merges web search/local retrieval results into prompts, and calls `api.py`.
- **`search.py`** – Provides web search capabilities (DuckDuckGo, Google) for context gathering.
- **`session.py`** – Loads, saves, and exports conversation sessions (JSON-based).
- **`local_retriever.py`** – Builds FAISS indexes and retrieves local text chunks for knowledge-based AI prompts.
